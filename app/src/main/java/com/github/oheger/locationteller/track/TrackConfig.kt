/**
 * A data class representing the configuration for location tracking.
 *
 * @param minTrackInterval the minimum track interval (in sec)
 * @param maxTrackInterval the maximum track interval (in sec)
 * @param intervalIncrementOnIdle the value (in sec) to increase the track
 * interval if the location has not changed
 * @param locationValidity the time (in sec) how long a location should stay
 * on the server
 * @param locationUpdateThreshold the threshold for the distance (in meters)
 * between the current location and the last one before an update is reported
 * @param retryOnErrorTime a time when the next location update should be
 * attempted after an error occurred (in sec)
 * @param gpsTimeout timeout for querying the current GPS location (in sec)
 * @param offlineStorageSize the maximum size of the offline storage; here
 * the data that could not be uploaded is stored until an internet connection
 * is available again
 * @param maxOfflineStorageSyncTime the maximum time frame (in sec) to sync the
 * offline storage
 * @param multiUploadChunkSize the number of data items from the offline
 * storage to upload in a single operation
 * @param autoResetStats a flag whether tracking statistics should be reset
 * automatically when tracking is started
 * @param maxSpeedIncrease a factor defining the maximum increase of speed to
 * be considered normal; this is used to detect wrong GPS locations: if the
 * speed between two GPS locations increases more than this factory, the
 * current locations is treated as inaccurate
 * @param walkingSpeed the average walking speed (in m/s); as long as the
 * speed is in this area, no illegal speed increment is reported
