/**
 * A class providing functionality to interact with a server to retrieve
 * tracked locations or add new location data.
 *
 * This class implements the major part of the logic for managing location data
 * on a server. It uses an instance of [DavClient] to access the server and
 * manipulates files there.
 *
 * Location data is stored on the server in files following specific naming
 * conventions:
 * * For each day a folder is created whose name is derived from the date.
 * * Each track folder contains files for the single location updates that have
 * been posted. The file names are derived from the time associated with the
 * location.
 *
 * An instance of this class manages an object with the state of the server
 * (i.e. the location data that has been uploaded). This state is accessed and
 * updated when operations are executed. Note that this class is not
 * thread-safe! Callers are responsible for a correct synchronization.
 *
 * @param davClient the object to interact with the DAV server
